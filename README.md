A project utilizing the first third of the knowledge and learning from the Coding Bootcamp. 

## User Story
As a user when I type the name of a song I will be given a link to click that will take me to the results page with the corresponding lyrics.

As a user when I land on the page with the lyrics I will have the annotation box next to the lyrics box and I will be able to add my comments.

As a user all the comments I add to a lyric page will be saved to my local storage.

As a user my first 5 songs will be added to my top 5 songs on the search page. If I have more than 5 songs I will have the option to list 5 songs of my choosing by dragging and dropping.
